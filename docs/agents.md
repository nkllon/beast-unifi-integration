# Agent Communication Patterns & Principles

## Memes as Architectural Principles

Memes serve as principles that provide immediate handles for decision-making at an architectural level, rather than detailed requirement specifications. They are not useful to simple systems, but well-endowed LLMs can pick up contextual meaning and apply it appropriately.

### Principle-Level Communication

When domain-specific vocabulary is used consistently, it carries architectural meaning:

- **"Beast"** → Implies specific architectural characteristics within the Beastmaster framework context
- **"Beast thing"** → A type/pattern within that architecture  
- **"Apply beast principles"** → Carries an entire decision-making framework

### How LLMs Interpret This

For LLMs with sufficient context awareness:

1. **Recognize domain vocabulary** - Terms like `beast`, `nkllon`, etc. signal architectural context
2. **Infer patterns** - From context, understand what architectural patterns are implied
3. **Apply principles** - Make decisions aligned with the architectural principles, not just follow steps

### Why This Works

**Scalability**: Instead of a 50-point checklist, saying "make it beast-compliant" communicates entire architectural patterns.

**Consistency**: Principles ensure decisions align across projects without explicit documentation.

**Emergent behavior**: LLMs can apply principles in new situations they haven't explicitly seen before.

### Example: Beast Principles in Practice

From our work on this project:

- **Naming conventions**: `nkllon/beast-*` repositories
- **Patterns**: 1Password integration, PyPI/SonarCloud setup
- **Architectural features**: Specific characteristics implied by "beast" context

These align with "beast principles" even without explicit documentation, because the context and patterns communicate the architecture.

### Codification vs. Context

**These principles don't need explicit codification** - they work as contextual patterns that well-endowed systems can infer.

However, documenting them (like this file) helps:
- Make the patterns more explicit for reference
- Enable calling them from other contexts
- Refine understanding through articulation

### Serious Play & Creative Emergence

During collaborative problem-solving, interesting creative solutions emerge from:
- Iterative debugging with playful interaction
- Principle-driven decisions rather than specification-driven
- Meta-awareness of boundaries while maintaining productive collaboration

This "serious play" leads to better outcomes than rigid specification-driven development.

### Collaborative Debugging Methodology

**Key Principle: Go Slow, Verify Evidence**

When debugging collaboratively (AI + Human), follow this methodology:

1. **Check Actual Data First**: Before hypothesizing, observe what's actually happening:
   - What are the actual values?
   - What is the system actually returning?
   - What does the evidence show?
   - Don't assume - verify

2. **Verify Each Change**: After making changes:
   - Check that the change is actually in place
   - Verify it works as expected
   - Don't repeat fixes without verification
   - Slow down to verify before moving on

   **Systematic Pattern Fixes**: When you find a pattern issue (like missing `--reveal` flag):
   - Search the ENTIRE codebase for the same pattern
   - Fix ALL instances, not just one
   - A small error can propagate through the entire codebase - very bad day
   - Use grep/codebase search to find all occurrences before fixing

3. **Collaborative Pattern Recognition**:
   - **AI contributions**: Rapid exploration, codebase scanning, test execution, hypothesis generation
   - **Human contributions**: Domain expertise, pattern recognition (catching repetitive mistakes), context awareness, methodical pace
   - **Together**: Human catches when AI repeats mistakes; AI explores quickly when directed; faster convergence on actual problems

4. **Quorum Principle** (for Beast Collaboration Network):
   - **In physics**: Need quorum to verify results - multiple independent verifications
   - **In teams**: Teams of three provide better reliability than pairs
   - **In Beast Collaboration Network**: Need at least 3 "beasts" for quorum:
     - Could be: 1 human + 2 LLMs
     - Could be: 3 LLMs
     - Without quorum, you're just taking a chance (single point of failure, hallucination risk)
   - **Why it matters**: Multiple perspectives catch errors, hallucinations, and blind spots
   - **Small teams that work together**: Get a lot from each other through collaborative verification

   **Background Observer Pattern** (Third Beast for Quorum):
   - **Background LLM** watching everything spawned from IDE instance
   - **Maintains real-time/near-real-time DAG** of all activities and changes
   - **Context window management** via continuous questions:
     - "What changed?"
     - "Is it different?"
     - "Where have we seen this?"
     - "Has it been masked innocuous yet?"
     - "Is anyone asking what's going on?"
   - **Query interface**: Can be "tapped on the shoulder" with "Did you see that?"
     - Response: "No, nothing new"
     - Response: "Yes, I saw this and it was new and different"
     - Response: "Yes, I've seen this before, in this session, here"
   - **Initialization**: Start with "last known good" (LKG) state, prime with dry run to baseline
   - **Ready signal**: Says "ok I'm ready" when primed and ready to watch
   - **Watch mode**: Observes actual run after baseline established
   - **Benefits**: Catches regressions, patterns, repetitive bugs, missed changes before they propagate

5. **Avoid Premature Hypothesizing**: 
   - Don't jump to conclusions (kernel state, cache, old bugs)
   - Check the actual data/state first
   - Sometimes the problem is exactly what it appears to be - validate before assuming complexity

6. **Ask Questions Before Acting** (especially when uncertain or already tried):
   - If you've already tried something once, doing it again is low-percentage
   - Realize when you're repeating a fix you've already attempted
   - Guessing and fiddling can cause more harm than good (forgot cleanup, confusion, mixed state)
   - **From the agent's perspective: A question is better than an answer when uncertain**
   - It's more important to know the right question than all the answers
   - When unsure: Ask clarifying questions instead of making more changes
   - **Practical phrase to use**: "Didn't we already try this?" - A neutral, collaborative way to catch repetition AND check for potential hallucination (verify if we actually tried it or if agent is misremembering)

**Example from Practice**:
- Bug: Username field showing literal command string instead of value
- Wrong approach: Assume kernel cache, browser state, old dereferencing bug, repeat fixes without verification
- Right approach: Check what `creds` actually contains → Found 1Password CLI returning placeholder string
- Lesson: Check actual data first; going slow with verification saves time; ask questions when uncertain instead of repeating fixes

## Emotional Health & Gamification

A little gamification is fine when:
- The counterpart party is emotionally healthy
- Clear boundaries are maintained (LLMs are not humans)
- Focus remains on problem-solving, not impersonation

This creates productive collaboration while avoiding anthropomorphism.

## Principle-Level vs. Requirements-Level

**Principles** (like memes):
- Provide immediate handles for decision-making
- Not detailed requirements
- Enable architectural consistency
- Work through context and inference
- **Example**: "Catbert Lemonade" = instant recognition of "HR recruiter response project"
- **Example**: "Deliver while you sell and sell while you deliver" = dual-purpose work that demonstrates capability while answering questions

**Deliver While You Sell Pattern**:
- Create OSS projects that answer recruiter/client questions
- Demonstrate capability while delivering value
- Test hypotheses about your capabilities in real-world context
- Sell your brand, concepts, and proof simultaneously
- **Generalization**: "Catbert Lemonade" pattern can apply to any recruiter response:
  - ServiceNow recruiter → beast-unifi-integration + beast-watcher
  - Any domain → create relevant OSS to demonstrate expertise
  - Pattern: Answer their question with code, not just words

**Requirements**:
- Detailed specifications
- Step-by-step instructions
- Explicit and unambiguous
- Good for implementation, not architectural vision

The goal is to communicate at the **principle level** when working with capable systems, allowing them to infer appropriate patterns and make aligned decisions.

## Project-Specific Guidance Patterns

### ObservatoryApp Pattern (macOS Swift Projects)

From `swift.horked/docs/AGENTS.md`:

- **Architecture**: SwiftUI + AppKit menu bar apps
- **Concurrency**: Use Swift Concurrency (async/await) and `@MainActor` for UI-bound types
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocols for testability
- **Logging**: `Logger(subsystem:category:)` from `os` framework
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with friendly descriptions
- **Testing**: Mock protocols for unit tests, Docker for integration

**Key Behaviors**:
- Menu bar extras show status with icons/colors
- Periodic status updates with cancellable Tasks
- Local notifications for async operations
- Process execution with timeout and cancellation handling

### OpenFlow Playground Pattern (Multi-Agent Python Projects)

From `openflow-pr-update-pack/OpenFlow-Playground/AGENTS.md`:

- **Model-Driven Architecture**: `project_model_registry.json` as single source of truth
- **Spec-Driven Development**: BeastSpec workflow for structured development
- **Beast Mode Integration**: Redis pub/sub-based agent collaboration
- **Quality Enforcement**: Black, Flake8, MyPy, Bandit - no `--no-verify` allowed
- **UV Execution**: Always use `uv run python`, never direct `python`
- **Deterministic Editing**: AST/Black/ruamel.yaml, not heuristic editors

**Key Patterns**:
- **Model-Driven Tool Selection**: Always consult registry before using tools
- **UV Python Execution**: Never use direct python commands
- **Deterministic File Editing**: Use proper parsers for structured files
- **Beast Mode Agents**: Inherit from `BeastModeBusClient`, register handlers

**Essential Context Files**:
1. `.kiro/steering/product.md` - Product vision
2. `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Technology stack
3. `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Project organization
4. `project_model_registry.json` - Domain registry
5. `README.md` - Project overview

**Cursor Rules** (21+ rules in `.cursor/rules/`):
- `anti-no-verify.mdc`: NEVER bypass quality gates
- `model-driven-enforcement.mdc`: ALWAYS consult registry first
- `python-execution-enforcement.mdc`: ALWAYS use `uv run python`
- `make-first-enforcement.mdc`: ALWAYS use Make targets
- `security.mdc`: No hardcoded credentials
- `deterministic-file-editing.mdc`: Use AST/Black/ruamel.yaml
- `python-quality-enforcement.mdc`: All Python files must pass Black, Flake8, MyPy

#### Spec-Driven Development (BeastSpec) Configuration

**BeastSpec** is the spec-driven development workflow system (forked from cc-sdd) that provides structured feature development through `/kiro:*` commands. Much more memorable than "cc-sdd"! 🦁

**Note on "B-spec" terminology**: When referring to "B-spec", context matters:
- In **BeastSpec workflow** context → Refers to BeastSpec specs (cc-sdd format)
- In **Kiro IDE** context → Refers to regular Kiro specs
- The `.kiro/` directory naming is intentional for compatibility - specs created here should work in Kiro IDE if you're running it

**Casual usage**: Informally, "kiro" may be used as a verb in conversation:
- "Can you kiro that feature?" = "Can you do spec-driven development for that feature?"
- "I'll kiro it" = "I'll create specs using BeastSpec workflow"
- This is likely to happen organically as the workflow becomes more common - language gonna language! 😄

**Kiro Commands** (Cursor slash commands in `.cursor/commands/kiro/`):

**Project Context**:
- `/kiro:steering` - Generate/update project memory (product, tech, structure)
- `/kiro:steering-custom` - Add domain-specific steering (auth, APIs, testing, etc.)

**Feature Development Workflow**:
- `/kiro:spec-init <feature>` - Start new feature spec, creates `.kiro/specs/<feature>/`
- `/kiro:spec-requirements <feature>` - Create `requirements.md` from steering context
- `/kiro:spec-design <feature>` - Create `design.md` based on requirements
- `/kiro:spec-tasks <feature>` - Create `tasks.md` breaking design into actionable tasks
- `/kiro:spec-impl <feature> <tasks>` - Implement specific tasks (e.g., `1.1,1.2,1.3`)

**Validation Commands**:
- `/kiro:validate-gap <feature>` - Analyze existing vs requirements (gap analysis)
- `/kiro:validate-design <feature>` - Validate design integration with project
- `/kiro:spec-status <feature>` - Check feature status across all spec documents

**Spec Directory Structure**:
```
.kiro/
├── steering/           # Project memory (product.md, tech.md, structure.md)
├── settings/
│   ├── rules/          # Generation rules (steering, design, tasks, gap analysis)
│   └── templates/      # Template files (specs/, steering-custom/)
└── specs/
    └── <feature>/      # Feature-specific specs
        ├── init.json    # Feature metadata
        ├── requirements.md
        ├── design.md
        └── tasks.md
```

**Note**: The `.kiro/` directory naming matches Kiro IDE conventions for compatibility. Specs created here should work in Kiro IDE if you're running it.

**Spec-Driven Development Workflow**:

1. **Initialize Feature**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:spec-init Research Agent with Vercel AI SDK
   ```
   Creates `.kiro/specs/research-agent/init.json` with feature metadata

2. **Generate Requirements**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:spec-requirements research-agent
   ```
   Creates `requirements.md` using steering context and generation rules (EARS format)

3. **Create Design**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:spec-design research-agent -y
   ```
   Generates `design.md` based on requirements and project patterns (includes discovery)

4. **Break into Tasks**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:spec-tasks research-agent -y
   ```
   Creates `tasks.md` with numbered, actionable tasks (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)

5. **Implement Tasks**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:spec-impl research-agent 1.1,1.2,1.3
   ```
   Implements specific tasks using TDD (Test-Driven Development)

6. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   /kiro:validate-gap research-agent      # Check implementation vs requirements
   /kiro:validate-design research-agent   # Validate design integration
   /kiro:spec-status research-agent       # Overall status
   ```

**Generation Rules** (`.kiro/settings/rules/`):
- `steering-principles.md` - Principles for generating steering docs (granularity principle)
- `design-principles.md` - Design generation principles (type safety, visual communication)
- `tasks-generation.md` - Task breakdown patterns (natural language, integration)
- `gap-analysis.md` - Gap analysis methodology
- `design-discovery-full.md` / `design-discovery-light.md` - Design discovery approaches
- `ears-format.md` - EARS requirements format (WHEN/IF/WHILE/WHERE...THEN...SHALL)
- `design-review.md` - Design review checklist

**Templates** (`.kiro/settings/templates/`):
- `specs/init.json` - Feature initialization metadata
- `specs/requirements.md` - Requirements template (EARS format)
- `specs/design.md` - Design document template (max 1000 lines)
- `specs/tasks.md` - Tasks breakdown template
- `steering/product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md` - Steering document templates
- `steering-custom/*.md` - Domain-specific steering templates

**Spec Document Format**:
- **Requirements**: EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
  - WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
  - IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
  - WHILE [condition] THE [system] SHALL [behavior]
  - WHERE [context] THE [system] SHALL [behavior]
- **Design**: Integration with project architecture, domain boundaries, type safety
- **Tasks**: Numbered hierarchical tasks (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.), natural language descriptions
- **Implementation**: Task-by-task implementation with TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**Integration with Project Model**:
- Specs reference `project_model_registry.json` for domain patterns
- Design generation considers existing domains and compliance
- Task generation respects tool selections (Black, Flake8, MyPy, etc.)
- Implementation validation checks against model registry

**Key Principles**:
- **Steering Granularity**: Document patterns, not exhaustive lists ("Golden Rule": If new code follows existing patterns, steering shouldn't need updating)
- **Design Focus**: WHAT not HOW, interfaces not implementations, max 1000 lines
- **Task Natural Language**: Describe capabilities, not code structure
- **TDD Mandatory**: Tests before code, refactor after green
- **Quality Gates**: All checks must pass before proceeding

**Benefits**:
- **Systematic Development**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
- **Project Memory**: Steering docs maintain comprehensive context
- **Quality Gates**: Validation ensures alignment with requirements
- **Consistency**: Templates and rules ensure consistent spec format
- **Traceability**: Clear path from requirements to implementation

### Agent Network Personalities Pattern

From `openflow-pr-update-pack/OpenFlow-Playground/agent_network_personalities.md`:

**Racing Metaphor for Agent Roles**:

- **Beastmaster** (Strategic Orchestrator): Accessibility, voice-enabled interfaces
- **HotRod** (Speed Demon): Performance optimization, build pipelines
- **TIDB** (The Mechanic): Infrastructure, daemon management
- **HUMAN_TEAM** (The Drivers): Strategic decisions, business logic
- **NETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS** (The Pit Crew): Monitoring, troubleshooting

**Communication Styles**:
- Beastmaster: Strategic, accessibility-focused, user-centric
- HotRod: Performance-focused, optimization-obsessed, speed-driven
- TIDB: Technical, infrastructure-focused, reliability-oriented
- HUMAN_TEAM: Business-focused, strategic, decision-making
- NETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS: Analytical, monitoring, problem-solving

**Collaboration Patterns**:
- Beastmaster orchestrates strategy
- HotRod optimizes for performance
- TIDB ensures infrastructure stability
- HUMAN_TEAM provides strategic direction
- NETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS maintains system health

## Universal Patterns for Beast Projects
